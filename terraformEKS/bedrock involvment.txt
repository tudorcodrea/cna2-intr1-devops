1. Automated Log and Metric Analysis for Insights
Description: Use Bedrock to process CloudWatch logs and metrics from your microservices (e.g., SNS publish rates, ELB latency, EKS pod CPU usage) and generate natural language summaries, anomaly detections, or recommendations. For example, Bedrock can analyze error logs to suggest root causes or predict potential failures based on historical data.
How It Works:
A Lambda function periodically queries CloudWatch (e.g., via get_metric_data or filter_log_events) for key metrics/logs.
The data is formatted as text and sent to Bedrock's InvokeModel API (e.g., using Anthropic's Claude model) with a prompt like: "Analyze these CloudWatch metrics for the Product Service: [data]. Identify anomalies and suggest optimizations."
Bedrock returns insights, which can be stored in S3, sent via SNS, or displayed in a dashboard.
Implementation Steps:
Create a Lambda function with Python runtime and Bedrock permissions (bedrock:InvokeModel).
Use Boto3 to query CloudWatch and invoke Bedrock.
Schedule the Lambda via EventBridge (e.g., every hour) or trigger on CloudWatch alarms.
Store outputs in DynamoDB or S3 for historical analysis.
